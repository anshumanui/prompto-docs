        <h1>The information system in the cloud</h1>

        <h2>Run in the cloud</h2>
        <p>Prompto is designed from the ground to run in the cloud, whether public or private.</p>
        <h3>How is this different from a traditional information system?</h3>
        <p>IT organisations often build applications with traditional deployment in mind.
            Later on, they eventually adapt applications to run in the cloud.
            Then they have a very hard time making these applications work together, and collaborate in the cloud.
        </p>
        <p>Prompto introduces a radically different approach, where the information system itself is in the cloud.
            This includes all core components of the information system: deployment, load balancing, replication, backup,
            monitoring, OS upgrades, DNS, authentication, entitlement and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>While Prompto takes care of infrastructure, security and scalability, applications running within this
            information system can focus on business value.
        </p>

        <h2>Build in the cloud</h2>
        <p>Prompto information systems are entirely built in the cloud. All infrastructure management applications are in the cloud.
            All application management applications are in the cloud. All application development applications are in the cloud,
            including the IDE for creating web pages and writing application code.</p>


        <h2>Prompto components</h2>
        <p>Prompto comprises different components:
        <ul>
            <li>hardware administration tools, used to manage deployment of applications on the infrastructure</li>
            <li>application administration tools, used to monitor execution of applications on the infrastructure</li>
            <li>development tools, used to build applications, test them, and manage their lifecycle</li>
            <li>a code store used to store and distribute configuration and application code across the infrastructure</li>
            <li>data store adapters, used to store business data in popular distributed data stores</li>
            <li>a programming language, called Prompto</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
