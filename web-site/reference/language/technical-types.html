        <h2>Types</h2>

        <p>This section describes types in the Prompto language.</p>
        <p>Programming languages are used to manipulate all sorts of values: text, image, numbers, time...<br/>
            Most languages associate values with types. This is required to determine which operations can be performed on a value, and how.<br/>
            Values can be provided using inline <i>literals</i>, like <code>123</code> or <code>"John"</code>.<br/>
            Values can also be read from a database, files, the internet and so forth.<br/>
            In both cases, manipulating values is often done using variables, which associate a name with a value.<br/>
            Writing <code>a = 123</code> binds the name <code>a</code> with the integer <code>123</code>.<br/>
            As a consequence, the type of <code>a</code> is integer.<br/>
            Prompto is statically typed, which means that the type of a variable cannot change.<br/>
            Prompto uses type inference, which means that generally, types only need to be declared for method parameters.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Prompto technical types</h2>

         <p>Prompto comes with built-in types for commonly used types of values.<br/>
            Prompto calls them <i>technical types</i>, because they are defined by their technical structure rather than their meaning.<br/>
            Value types are technical types which can hold a single 'atomic' value: text, number, date and so forth.
            Collection types are technical types which can hold multiple values, typically of the same atomic type.<br/>
            Special types are technical types which do not contain information but are useful during program execution<br/>
         </p>
        <p>Prompto also supports <i>semantic types</i> and <i>composed types</i>, however these are user defined (although Prompto libraries may define some).<br/>
            See attributes and categories for the definition of semantic and composed types.
        </p>

        <p>Being statically typed, Prompto sometimes requires that the type of an object be specified.<br/>
            This is achieved by simply providing the type name.<br/>
            The exact syntax depends on the dialect and the fragment being defined.<br/>
            The below is an example of an attribute declaration in the E dialect.
        <pre><code>define name as Text attribute</code></pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Value types</h2>
        <p>Value types are technical types which can only hold a single 'atomic' value.</p>

        <h2>Text</h2>

        <p>The <code>Text</code> type is a technical type used for values such as a name or description, where the textual representation
            and the meaning are equivalent.<br/>
            All Text values use <a target = "_blank" href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a> internally.<br/>
            A Text literal must be enclosed in double quotes.<br/>
        <pre><code>"This is a text literal."</code></pre>
        <br/>
        If a Text literal must contain a double-quote, that double-quote must be escaped using the anti-slash '\' character.<br/><br/>
        <pre><code>"This text literal contains two \"double quotes\"."</code></pre>
        <br/>
        Consequently, if a Text literal must contain the anti-slash'\' character, the '\' character must be escaped using the '\' character.<br/><br/>
        <pre><code>"This text literal contains one anti-slash: \\."</code></pre>
        <br/>
        Additionally, Text literals support the following special characters:<br/><br/>
        <pre><code>"\t" -> Tab
"\b" -> Back space
"\n" -> New line
"\r" -> Carriage return
"\f" -> Form feed
"\'" -> Single quote</code></pre>
        <br/>
        Finally, Text literals support <a target = "_blank" href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a> characters in the form of UTF-16 hexadecimal characters:<br/><br/>
        <pre><code>"delta: \u0394" -> delta: &delta;</code></pre>
        <br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Character</h2>

        <p>The <code>Character</code> type is a technical type used for easy manipulation of single characters.<br/>
            Like Text values, all Character values use <a target = "_blank" href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a> internally.<br/>
            Character literals support the same escape characters as Text literals.<br/>
            A Character literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
        <pre><code>'c' -> the 'c' character</code></pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Boolean</h2>

        <p>The <code>Boolean</code> type is a technical type used exclusively for the values true and false.<br/>
            A Boolean literal is simply one of the words <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.<br/>
            Alternately, Prompto also supports the words <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Integer</h2>

        <p>The <code>Integer</code> type is a technical type used for integral numbers, using 8 bytes, thus ranging from -2<sup>63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup>-1.<br/>
            An Integer literal is simply a sequence of digits, such as <code>13465</code>.<br/>
            Prompto also supports Integer literals using hexadecimal notation, such as <code>0xA3B2FE</code>.<br/>
            Finally, Prompto supports 2 special Integers, <code>MIN_INTEGER</code> and <code>MAX_INTEGER</code>.
        </p>

        <h2>Decimal</h2>

        <p>The <code>Decimal</code> type is a technical type used for non integral numbers, using 8 bytes as specified by
            <a target = "_blank" href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/">IEE 754</a>.<br/>
            A Decimal literal is simply a sequence of digits, followed by a dot and another sequence of digits, such as <code>13465.02</code>.<br/>
            Prompto also supports Decimal literals using scientific notation, such as <code>0.074e32</code>.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that due to their internal binary representation, not all Decimal values can be accurately represented.<br/>
            For example, the internal representation for <code>1.3</code> is actually <code>1.2999999999999998</code>.<br/>
            See this <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html">detailed explanation</a> with more examples.
        </p>

        <h2>Time</h2>

        <p>The <code>Time</code> type is a technical type used for to represent a time of day. It does not support time zones.<br/>
            A Time literal is a sequence of 2 to 4 integers, separated by a semi colon ':' or a dot for the last one,
            representing the hour of day, the minute, the optional second and the optional millisecond.<br/>
            A Time literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>
            A Time literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
        <pre><code>'13:07' -> 13 hours and 7 minutes
'13:07:02.013' -> 13 hours, 7 minutes, 2 seconds and 13 milliseconds</code></pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Date</h2>

        <p>The <code>Date</code> type is a technical type used to represent a day. It does not support time zones.<br/>
            A Date literal is a sequence of 3 integers, separated by a hyphen '-',
            representing the year, the month and the day of the month.<br/>
            A Date literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>
            A Date literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
        <pre><code>'1981-05-12' -> 12th of May of year 1981</code></pre>
        </p>


        <h2>DateTime</h2>

        <p>The <code>DateTime</code> type is a technical type used to represent an instant, with time zone support.<br/>
            A DateTime literal is formed by a Date literal, followed by a 'T', followed by a Time literal,
            optionally followed by a time zone offset.<br/>
            A DateTime literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>
            A DateTime literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
            If a time zone offset is not specified, the literal is interpreted in the time zone of the eoperating system.</br>
        <pre><code>'1981-05-12T13:02:11.002' -> 13 hours, 2 minutes, 11 seconds and 2 milliseconds on the 12th of May of year 1981
'1981-05-12T13:02:11.002+0200' -> same date time as above, in the GMT + 02:00 time zone</code></pre>
        </p>


        <h2>Period</h2>

        <p>The <code>Period</code> type is a technical type used to represent a period of time, or a duration.<br/>
            A Period literal is formed by a 'P' followed by a sequence of integral quantities preceded by their unit, see examples.<br/>
            Day level units and time level units are separated by a 'T', as in DateTime literals.<br/>
            A Period literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>
            A Period literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
        <pre><code>'PY3W2' -> 3 years + 2 weeks
'PM4D1' -> 4 months + 1 day
'PD1TH2' -> 1 day + 2 hours
'PTM4S173' -> 4 minutes + 173 seconds</code></pre>
        </p>

        <h2>Document</h2>

        <p>The <code>Document</code> type is a technical type used to manipulate arbitrary data structures with loose typing.<br/>
            A Document has items which can be of any type, atomic, collection or Document.<br/>
            A Document is useful to carry data read from the store, from files or from the Internet, and convert it to typed data.<br/>
            A Document is also useful to write typed data to the store, to files or to the Internet.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Blob</h2>

        <p>The <code>Blob</code> (<b>B</b>inary <b>L</b>arge <b>OB</b>ject) type is a technical type used to hold an arbitray list of raw bytes.<br/>
            A Blob has a mime type, which is useful to describe the type of the binary data, notably over the Internet.<br/>
            There is no Blob literal.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Image</h2>

        <p>The <code>Image</code> type is a specialized Blob type used to hold displayable binary data, such as a JPEG image.<br/>
            An Image has a mime type, which is useful to describe the type of the binary data, notably over the Internet.<br/>
            There is no Image literal.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>UUID</h2>

        <p>The <code>UUID</code> type is a technical type often used in IT systems such as databases, to provide unique identifiers.<br/>
            A UUID generator is a system which using specific hardware unique data such as MAC address, and current instant,
            is able to generate a globally <b>U</b>niversal <b>U</b>nique <b>ID</b>entifier.<br/>
            A UUID literal is a sequence of characters, digits and hyphens which conform to the <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122 specification</a>.<br/>
            A UUID literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
        <pre><code>'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000' -> a valid UUID</code></pre>
        </p>
