        <h2>Methods arguments</h2>

        <p>A Prompto category method can accept 0 or more arguments.</p>
        <p>Arguments must be declared (there is no implicit argument such as <i>arguments</i> in JavaScript).</p>
        <p>When mutiple arguments are declared, they must be separated by commas. In E dialect only, the last comma is replaced by the <code>and</code> keyword.</p>
        <p>Arguments are typed, in one of the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Attribute argument</b>, with the form <code><i>name</i></code>, where <code><i>name</i></code> is an existing Attribute name.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-12-lines" name="c1" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p/>
                    <p>When the attribute is the first argument, it can be automatically <i>extracted</i> from the object:</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-14-lines" name="c2" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p/>
                    <p>In the above example, the <i>printVisit</i> method expects a <i>country</i> as argument. Since <i>City</i> has a <i>country</i> attribute,
                        Prompto is able to automatically extract it.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Typed argument</b>, with the form <code><i>Type x</i></code>, where <code><i>type</i></code> is an existing Type name
                    and <code><i>x</i></code> can be any valid variable identifier.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c3" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>

                    <p/>
                </li>
                <li><b>Anonymous type attribute argument</b>, with the form <code>any <i>x</i> with attribute <i>name</i></code>, where <code><i>x</i></code> can be any valid variable
                    identifier and <code><i>name</i></code> is an existing Attribute name. This form accepts more than one attribute.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-16-lines" name="c4" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p/>
                </li>
                <li><b>Extended type argument</b>, with the form <code><i>Type x</i> with attribute <i>name</i></code>,
                    where <code><i>type</i></code> is an existing category name, <code><i>x</i></code> can be any valid variable
                    identifier and <code><i>name</i></code> is an existing Attribute name. This form accepts more than one attribute.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-16-lines" name="c5" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>

                    <p/>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Mixing argument types</h4>
        <p>When a category method expects mutiple arguments, argument types can be mixed as required. </p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-16-lines" name="c6" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <h4>Default argument values</h4>
        <p>Prompto supports <i>default</i> argument values, which remove the need to always pass all arguments to a method.</p>
        <p>Default argument values must be <i>constant</i> values, i.e. they cannot vary during program execution. Good candidates are literals, null, and enumerated values.</p>
