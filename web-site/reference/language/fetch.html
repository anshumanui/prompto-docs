        <h2>Fetch expressions</h2>

        <p>Fetch expressions are used to fetch objects from the data store.</p>

        <h3>
            Fetching one object
        </h3>
        <p>Fetching one object from the store produces an object which can then be used as an input for other constructs.<br/>
            Such an expression has the form <code>fetch one where <i>predicate</i> ( and/or <i>predicate</i> )</code>,
            where <code><i>predicate</i></code> is a boolean expression in which any attribute can be used to filter the data.</p>
            The type of the object retrieved is the type it had the last time the object was stored (or null if no object was found).
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c1" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable with-framework></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>
            Fetching one object with a given category
        </h3>
        <p>Fetch expressions can be specialized to return an object of a given user type.<br/>
            The type of the variable to which the object is assigned is the specified user type.<br/>
            The type of the object retrieved is the type it had the last time the object was stored (or null if no object was found).<br/>
            The type is specified as follows:
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-12-lines" name="c2" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable with-framework></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>
            Fetching multiple objects
        </h3>
        <p>Fetching multiple objects from the store produces a Cursor which can be used as an input for iterating constructs.<br/>
            Such an expression has the form <code>fetch all where <i>predicate</i> ( and/or <i>predicate</i> )</code>,
            where <code><i>predicate</i></code> is a boolean expression in which any attribute can be used to filter the data.</p>
            The type of each object retrieved is the type it had the last time the object was stored.
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-14-lines" name="c3" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable with-framework></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>
            Fetching multiple objects with a given category
        </h3>
        <p>Similarly to fetching one object, fetching multiple objects expressions can be specialized to return only objects of a given user type.<br/>
            The item type of the cursor to which the object is assigned is the specified user type.<br/>
            The type of each object retrieved is the type the object had the last time the object was stored.<br/>
            The type is specified as follows:
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-14-lines" name="c4" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable with-framework></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>When running the above example, you'll notice that Person "Sophie" is not returned because it is not a Member.<br/>
