        <h2>Methods</h2>

        <p>Prompto supports both <i>global</i> methods and <i>category</i> methods.</p>
        <p>In this section, we describe <i>global</i> methods only, <i>category</i> methods are described in the <i>Categories</i> section.</p>
        <p>A method is identified by its prototype, defined by its name and its accepted arguments.</p>

        <h3>Defining methods</h3>
        <p>A method is defined by declaring its prototype and optional return value, followed by the method statements.</p>
        <p>The minimal prototype has the following form:
        <ul>
            <li>In E dialect: <code>define <i>methodName</i> as method doing:</code></li>
            <li>In O dialect: <code><i>methodName</i>() {}</code></li>
            <li>In S dialect: <code>def <i>methodName</i>():</code></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Method names</h3>
        <p>A method name can be any valid identifier i.e. a word starting with a letter and followed by any number of letters or digits.</p>
        <h3>Method return types</h3>
        <p>A Prompto method can return any number of values.</p>
        <p>If no value is returned, the return type is known as <code>Void</code> type.</p>
        <p>If more than one value is returned, the return type is <code>Tuple</code>.</p>
        <p>If exactly 1 value is returned, the return type can be specified. When not specified, it is inferred by Prompto.</p>
        <p>Specifying the return type is done as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>In E dialect: <code>define <i>methodName</i> as method returning <i>Type</i> doing:</code> </li>
            <li>In O dialect: <code><i>Type methodName</i>() {}</code></li>
            <li>In S dialect: <code>def <i>methodName</i>() -> <i>Type</i>:</code></li>
        </ul>
        where <code><i>Type</i></code> is the name of an existing type.
        </p>
        <h3>Method arguments</h3>
        <p>A Prompto method can accept 0 or more arguments.</p>
        <p>Arguments must be declared (there is no implicit argument such as <i>arguments</i> in JavaScript).</p>
        <p>Arguments are typed, in one of the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attribute argument, with the form <p><code><i>name</i></code>, where <code><i>name</i></code> is an existing Attribute name.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-6-lines" name="c1" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                </li>
                <li>Explicitly typed argument, with the form <p><code><i>Type x</i></code>, where <code><i>type</i></code> is an existing Type name
                    and <code><i>x</i></code> can be any valid variable identifier.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-4-lines" name="c2" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                </li>
                <li>Extended type argument, with the form <p><code><i>Type x</i> with attribute <i>name</i></code>,
                    where <code><i>type</i></code> is an existing category name, <code><i>x</i></code> can be any valid variable
                    identifier and <code><i>name</i></code> is an existing Attribute name. This form accepts more than one attribute.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c3" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                </li>
                <li>Anonymous type argument, with the form <p><code>any <i>x</i> with attribute <i>name</i></code>, where <code><i>x</i></code> can be any valid variable
                    identifier and <code><i>name</i></code> is an existing Attribute name. This form accepts more than one attribute.</p>
                    <div>
                        <iframe class="displayer" name="c4" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>When mutiple arguments are declared, argument types can be mixed as required. </p>
        <p>When mutiple arguments are declared, they must be separated by commas. In E dialect only, the last comma is replaced by the <code>and</code> keyword.</p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-4-lines" name="c5" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <h3>Method <i>overloading</i></h3>
        <p>Prompto supports method <i>overloading</i>, where 2 methods have the same name but unrelated parameters.</p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c6" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <p>When a method is <i>overloaded</i>, Prompto selects the most appropriate one based on the best match of the <i>proposed</i> parameters
            with respect to the required arguments. This matching if performed using the sequence of the parameteres in the method call.</p>

        <h3>Method <i>overriding</i></h3>
        <p>Prompto supports method <i>overriding</i>, where a method can be overloaded using different but compatible parameters.
            Each <i>overridden</i> method provides a behavior specific to its argument types.</p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-12-lines" name="c7" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>When a method is <i>overridden</i>, Prompto selects the most appropriate one at runtime i.e. the one for which the <i>actual</i> parameters best match the required method arguments,
            based on the sequence of the method call. This is different from many languages such as Java, C# or C++,
            where the resolution is decided at compile time. </p>

        <h3><i>Abstract</i> methods</h3>
        <p>Prompto supports <code><i>abstract</i></code> methods, a special type of method, which <i>must</i> be overridden.</p>
            Abstract methods are resolved at runtime based on the actual type of the value.</p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-12-lines" name="c8" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>Abstract methods are well suited when no actual behaviour can be determined for an argument type (such as <i>Shape</i>).</p>
        <p/>
        <h3><i>Abstract</i> methods as arguments</h3>
        <p>Abstract methods can also be used as arguments for other method definitions:</p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-12-lines" name="c9" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>The method caller is responsible for providing a non abstract method compatible with the argument's method type.</p>
