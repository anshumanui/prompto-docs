        <h2>Read expressions</h2>

        <p>Read expressions are used to read content from a resource such as a file or a web site.<br/>
            A read expression is a code fragment which produces a <code>Text</code> value, which can then be used as an input for other operations: print, write, method call and so forth.<br/>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Reading the entire content of an inline resource
        </h3>
        <p>Reading the entire content of a resource can be achieved using an inline resource.<br/>

        <h3>
            Checking type of user defined values
        </h3>
        <p>When checking type of user defined values, Prompto checks for compatibility rather than equality.<br/>

        <h3>
            Auto downcast
        </h3>
        <p>When checking type of user defined values in an <code>if</code> statement, Prompto automatically downcasts the value type for the corresponding statements.
