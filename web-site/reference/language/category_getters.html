        <h2>Getters</h2>

        <p>Category attributes can be accessed using <code><i>instance</i>.<i>name</i></code>, where <code><i>instance</i></code> is a value and <code><i>name</i></code>
            is the name of a an attribute supported by this value.<br/>
            This covers most use cases, but there are situations where you want the returned value to be computed, rather than just read from the object.
            This is where <i>getters</i> are useful.<br/>
            <i>Getters</i> are special methods defined as part of a category definition, and attached to a particular attribute name.
            When a getter is defined and a piece of code tries to read the corresponding attribute, Prompto will call the <i>getter</i> instead.<br/>
            In the below example, we define a <i>getter</i> for a <i>fullName</i> attribute:
         </p>
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-12-lines" name="c1" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <h2>Mutability</h2>
        <p>Before talking about setters, it is worth reminding that unless specified Prompto values are <i>immutable</i>.
            As a consequence, the below code is illegal and cannot be executed:</p>
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-8-lines" name="c2" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <p>This is because the <i>Person</i> object assigned to variable <i>p</i> is not marked as <code>mutable</code>.</p>
        <p>In order to set an attribute value, the category instance must me marked as mutable when created. The below code will run:</p>
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c3" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <h2>Setters</h2>

        <p>Category attributes can normally be set on <code>mutable</code> objects using <code><i>instance</i>.<i>name</i> = <i>expression</i></code>,
            where <code><i>instance</i></code> is a value, <code><i>name</i></code> is the name of a an attribute supported by this value, and <code><i>expression</i></code>
            is an expression returning a value compatible with the type of <code><i>name</i></code>.<br/>
            This covers most use cases, but there are situations where you want to:
            <ul>
                <li>validate the value in a way which is not supported by attribute constraints</li>
                <li>transform the value "on the fly" rather than just store it</li>
                <li>take the opportunity to populate other values</li>
            </ul>
            This is where <i>setters</i> are useful.<br/>
            <i>Setters</i> are special methods defined as part of a category definition, and attached to a particular attribute name.
            When a setter is defined and a piece of code tries to set the corresponding attribute, including when the object is created,
            Prompto will call the <i>setter</i> to transform the value prior to setting it.<br/>
            Within the setter method body, the name of the attribute being set holds the value received, which can be used for whatever purpose.
            The setter is a function which MUST return the value to be written.
            In the below example, we define a <i>setter</i> for a <i>fullName</i> attribute which returns a capitalized value, and sets the <i>initials</i> attribute:
        </p>
        <p/>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-20-lines" name="c4" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <h4>Cyclical dependencies</h4>
        <p><i>Prompto manages cyclical dependencies between getters and setters. Cyclical dependencies occur when for example getter for 'a' reads 'b' and getter for 'b' reads 'a'.
            During the execution of a getter or setter body, it is guaranteed that the getter or setter being executed will not be called again for the current object
            until the execution of the initial getter/setter is complete.</i></p>
