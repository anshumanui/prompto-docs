            <h2>Prompto built-in types</h2>

            <p>Like most languages, Prompto comes with built-in types for commonly used types of values.<br/>
                Atomic types are built-in types which can hold a single 'atomic' value: text, number, date and so forth.
                Collection types are built-in types which can hold multiple values, typically of the same atomic type.<br/>
                Special types are built-in types which have no textual representation, but are useful for manipulating key programming objects<br/>
                Prompto also supports composed types, however these are user defined (although Prompto libraries may define some).
                See attributes and categories for the definition of composed types.
            </p>

            <h2>Atomic types</h2>
            <p>Atomic types are built-in types which can only hold a single 'atomic' value.</p>

            <h2>Text</h2>

            <p>The Text built-in type is used for values such as a name or description, where the textual representation
                and the meaning are equivalent.<br/>
                All Text values use <a target = "_blank" href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a> internally.<br/>
                A Text literal must be enclosed in double quotes.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    "This is a text literal."
                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            If a Text literal must contain a double-quote, that double-quote must be escaped using the anti-slash '\' character.<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    "This text literal contains two \"double quotes\"."
                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Consequently, if a Text literal must contain the anti-slash'\' character, the '\' character must be escaped using the '\' character.<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    "This text literal contains one anti-slash: \\."
                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Additionally, Text literals support the following special characters:<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    "\t"	-> Tab<br/>
                    "\b"	-> Back space<br/>
                    "\n"	-> New line<br/>
                    "\r"	-> Carriage return<br/>
                    "\f"	-> Form feed<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Finally, Text literals support <a target = "_blank" href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a> characters in the form of UTF-16 hexadecimal characters:<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    "delta: \u0394" -> delta: &delta;
                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            </p>

            <h2>Character</h2>

            <p>The Character built-in type is used for easy manipulation of single characters.<br/>
                Like Text values, all Character values use <a target = "_blank" href="http://unicode.org">Unicode</a> internally.<br/>
                Character literals support the same escape characters as Text literals.<br/>
                A Character literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    'c' -> the 'c' character
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Boolean</h2>

            <p>The Boolean built-in type is used exclusively for the values true and false.<br/>
                A Boolean literal is simply one of the words <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.<br/>
                Alternately, Prompto also supports the words <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.
            </p>

            <h2>Integer</h2>

            <p>The Integer built-in type is used for integral numbers, using 8 bytes, thus ranging from -2<sup>63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup>-1.<br/>
                An Integer literal is simply a sequence of digits, such as <code>13465</code>.<br/>
                Prompto also supports Integer literals using hexadecimal notation, such as <code>0xA3B2FE</code>.<br/>
                Finally, Prompto supports 2 special Integers, MIN_INTEGER and MAX_INTEGER.
            </p>

            <h2>Decimal</h2>

            <p>The Decimal built-in type is used for non integral numbers, using 8 bytes as specified by
                <a target = "_blank" href="http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/">IEE 754</a>.<br/>
                A Decimal literal is simply a sequence of digits, followed by a dot and another sequence of digits, such as <code>13465.02</code>.<br/>
                Prompto also supports Decimal literals using scientific notation, such as <code>0.074e32</code>.<br/>
            </p>

            <h2>Time</h2>

            <p>The Time built-in type is used for to represent a time of day. It does not support time zones.<br/>
                A Time literal is a sequence of 2 to 4 integers, separated by a semi colon ':' or a dot for the last one,
                representing the hour of day, the minute, the optional second and the optional millisecond.<br/>
                A Time literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>
                A Time literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    '13:07' -> 13 hours and 7 minutes<br/>
                    '13:07:02.013' -> 13 hours, 7 minutes, 2 seconds and 13 milliseconds
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Date</h2>

            <p>The Date built-in type is used to represent a day. It does not support time zones.<br/>
                A Date literal is a sequence of 3 integers, separated by a hyphen '-',
                representing the year, the month and the day of the month.<br/>
                A Date literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>

            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    '1981-05-12' -> 12th of May of year 1981
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>


            <h2>DateTime</h2>

            <p>The DateTime built-in type is used for to represent an instant, with time zone support.<br/>
                A DateTime literal is formed by a Date literal, followed by a 'T', followed by a Time literal,
                optionally followed by a time zone offset.<br/>
                A DateTime literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>
                A DateTime literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    '1981-05-12T13:02:11.002' -> 13 hours, 2 minutes, 11 seconds and 2 milliseconds on the 12th of May of year 1981<br/>
                    '1981-05-12T13:02:11.002+0200' -> same date time as above, in the GMT + 02:00 time zone
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>


            <h2>Period</h2>

            <p>The Period built-in type is used for to represent a period of time, or a duration.<br/>
                A Period literal is formed by a 'P' followed by a sequence of integral quantities preceded by their unit, see examples.<br/>
                Day level units and time level units are separated by a 'T', as in DateTime literals.<br/>
                A Period literal conforms to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>.<br/>
                A Period literal must be enclosed in single quotes.<br/>

            </p>

            <h2>Blob</h2>

            <p>The Blob (<b><i>B</i></b>inary <b><i>L</i></b>arge <b><i>OB</i></b>ject) built-in type is a type used to hold an arbitray list of raw bytes.<br/>
                A Blob has a mime type, which is useful to describe the type of the binary data, notably over the Internet.<br/>
                There is no Blob literal.<br/>
            </p>

            <h2>Image</h2>

            <p>The Image built-in type is a specialized Blob type used to hold displayable bynary data, such a JPEG image.<br/>
                An Image has a mime type, which is useful to describe the type of the binary data, notably over the Internet.<br/>
                There is no Image literal.<br/>
            </p>

            <h2>UUID</h2>

            <p>The UUID built-in type is a type often used in IT systems such as databases, to provide unique identifiers.<br/>
                A UUID generator is a system which using specific hardware unique data such as MAC address, and current instant,
                is able to generate a globally <b><i>U</i></b>niversal <b><i>U</i></b>nique <b><i>ID</i></b>entifier.<br/>
                A UUID literal is a sequence of characters, digits and hyphens which conform to the <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122 specification</a>.<br/>

            <h2>Collection types</h2>

            <p>Collection types are built-in types which can hold multiple values, typically of the same atomic type.<br/></p>

            <h2>List</h2>

            <p>The List built-in type is used to keep together 0 or more items of the same type.<br/>
                The items themselves can be of any type.<br/>
                A List literal must be enclosed in square brackets '[' and ']', the items being separated by a comma ','.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    [12, 15, -3] -> a List of 3 Integers<br/>
                    ["Paris", "London", "Singapore"] -> a List of 3 Texts<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Items in a List can be accessed individually using their position.<br/>
            Positions start at 1 and end at the list length.<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    a = [12, 15, -3] -> assign a List of 3 Integers to variable 'a'<br/>
                    a[1] -> get item at position 1 in List referenced by variable 'a' i.e. the Integer 12<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Tuple</h2>

            <p>The Tuple built-in type is used to keep together 0 or more items of different types.<br/>
                The items themselves can be of any type.<br/>
                A Tuple literal must be enclosed in parenthesis '(' and ')', the items being separated by a comma ','.<br/>
                For Tuple comprising 0 or 1 item, because the above could be interpreted as a parenthesized expression, a comma ',' must precede the right parenthesis.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    (,) -> the empty Tuple

                    ("Paris", '2015-06-12', -113.87) -> a Tuple of 3 items<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Items in a Tuple can be accessed individually using their position.<br/>
            Positions start at 1 and end at the list length.<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    a = ("Paris", '2015-06-12', -113.87) -> assign a Tuple of 3 items to variable 'a'<br/>
                    a[1] -> get item at position 1 in Tuple referenced by variable 'a' i.e. the Text "Paris"<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Set</h2>

            <p>The Set built-in type is used to keep together 0 or more <b><i>distinct</i></b> items of the same type.<br/>
                The items themselves can be of any type.<br/>
                A Set literal must be enclosed in angle brackets '<' and '>', the items being separated by a comma ','.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>

                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Items in a Set can be accessed individually using their position.<br/>
            However this is discouraged, because the position in the Set may change internally when ensuring uniqueness.<br/>
            Set items are generally accessed using iterators or predicates.<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    s = <12, 15, -3> -> assign a Set of 3 Integers to variable 's'<br/>
                    for each i in s -> iterate over items in Set referenced by variable 's'<br/>
                    s contains 12 -> return true if Set referenced by variable 's' contains the Integer 12<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Dictionary</h2>

            <p>The Dictionary built-in type is used to keep together 0 or more items of the same type and access them using a Text key.<br/>
                The items themselves can be of any type.<br/>
                A Dictionary literal must be enclosed in curly brackets '{' and '}', the items being separated by a comma ',', the key and value being separated by a semi colon ':'.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    {} -> an empty Dictionary<br/>

                </code>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Items in a Dictionary can be accessed individually using their key.<br/><br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    d = { "Paris" : "France", "London" : "England" } -> assign a Dictionary of 2 Texts to variable 'd'<br/>

            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Document</h2>

            <p>The Document built-in type is used to manipulate arbitrary data structures with loose typing.<br/>
                A Document has items which can be of any type, atomic, collection or Document.<br/>
                A Document is useful to carry data read from the store, from files or from the Internet, and convert it to typed data.<br/>
                A Document is also useful to write typed data to the store, to files or to the Internet.<br/>
            </p>

            <h2>Range</h2>

            <p>The Range built-in type is used to create sequences of 1 or more items of the same discrete type.<br/>
                The items themselves can only be of type Character, Integer, Date or Time.<br/>
                A Range literal must be enclosed in square brackets '[' and ']', the start and end value being separated by 2 dots '..'.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    [1..17] -> all Integers ranging from 1 to 17 included<br/>

            <h2>Special types</h2>
            <p>Special types are built-in types which are used in specific situations.</p>

            <h2>Any</h2>

            <p>The Any built-in type is a general type to represent any type.<br/>
                This type is useful for describing parameter types by attribute.<br/>
                It can also be useful to hold typed collections where the type is not known at compile time.<br/>
                It is also useful to represent opaque native types.<br/>
            </p>

            <h2>Method</h2>

            <p>The Method built-in type is a type used to hold Prompto methods.<br/>
                Prompto supports passing methods as parameters.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    m = myMethod -> assign the method 'myMethod' to variable 'm'<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Code</h2>

            <p>The Code built-in type is a type used to represent Prompto code.<br/>
                Prompto supports passing code snippets as parameters, so this is useful for passing code to methods.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    c = Code: a + b -> assign the Prompto code 'a + b' to variable 'c'<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Iterator</h2>

            <p>The Iterator built-in type is a type produced by Prompto when transforming a collection inline.<br/>
             <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    x + 1 for each x in [1..5] -> returns an Iterator which will produce an item on each iteration<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
            </p>

            <h2>Cursor</h2>

            <p>The Cursor built-in type is a type used to navigate through data returned by the data store.<br/>
            <div style="margin-left: 50px">
                <code>
                    c = fetch all -> returns a Cursor which will produce an item on each iteration<br/>
                </code>
            </div>
