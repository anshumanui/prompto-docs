        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Prompto is a platform for building and running information systems.<br/>
        It comprises different components:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>a code store used to store and distribute application code across the infrastructure</li>
            <li>data store adapters, used to store business data in popular distributed data stores</li>
            <li>administration tools, used to manage execution of applications on the infrastructure</li>
            <li>development tools, used to build applications, test them, and validate them</li>
            <li>a programming language, named Prompto</li>
        </ul>
        This reference focuses on the programming language, and may sometimes refer to other components.
        </p>

        <h2>Business applications</h2>

        <p>Business applications are applications which focus on business logic and user interaction,
            as opposed to middleware applications which focus on technical tasks such as data storage,
            message broadcasting, or serving web pages.<br/>
            Business applications typically make heavy use of a data store, and span across multiple components: data store, back end and front end.<br/>
            Prompto is designed to help organizations be more effective in building business applications.<br/>
            It achieves this by focusing on business logic, integration and presentation, while still relying for technical tasks
            on the exceptional ecosystems available from traditional platforms.
        </p>

        <h2>Run everywhere</h2>

        <p>Business applications are typically built using languages such as Java, C#, Python, JavaScript or Swift.<br/>
            Prompto does not aim to compete with these languages, but rather to complement them with a specific focus
            on business data modeling and storage.<br/>
            There is a Prompto runtime for each of the above host languages, and they are 100% compatible with each other.<br/>
            Prompto runs as part of its host languages and thus fully integrates with them.<br/>
            Prompto comprises data manipulation instructions which remove the need to program in SQL.<br/>
            Prompto natively integrates with any back end infrastucture, browsers, Java RCP, .Net RCP
            and native iOS applications <i>(Swift runtime not available yet)</i>.
        </p>

        <h2>Interpreted <i>and</i> compiled</h2>

        <p>Prompto runs in both interpreted and compiled mode.<br/>
            There are good reasons for supporting both interpreted and compiled mode:
            <ul>
                <li>In scripting mode, and in the REPL, code is executed line by line, it cannot be compiled.</li>
                <li>The interpreter is able to run incorrect code, notably tests, which can be useful during development. Incorrect code will fail to compile.</li>
                <li>Transpiled code (in Python and JavaScript) is hard to debug because it does not map exactly to Prompto code.</li>
            </ul>
            The Java runtime comes with an interpreter and a compiler which is able to compile Prompto code to JVM byte code.<br/>
            The C# runtime comes with an interpreter and a compiler which is able to compile Prompto code to CLR byte code <i>(compiler not available yet)</i>.<br/>
            The Python 2 and Python 3 runtimes come with an interpreter and a transpiler which is able to transpile Prompto code to Python byte code <i>(transpiler not available yet)</i>.<br/>
            The JavaScript runtime come withs an interpreter and a transpiler which is able to transpile Prompto code to JavaScript code <i>(transpiler not available yet)</i>.<br/>
            <i>The Swift runtime is planned but not available yet</i>.
       </p>

        <h2>Statically inferred types</h2>

        <p>Prompto uses static typing, like Java or C# do. This ensures best performance on all platforms.<br/>
            Prompto implements type inference, thus freeing the developer from having to declare obvious types:<br/>
            When writing <code>a = 123</code> code, it is obvious that <code>a</code> is an integer, so there is no need to declare it.<br/>
            Method parameter types still need to be declared though, because they cannot be inferred.
        </p>

        <h2>Reified attributes</h2>

        <p>Prompto introduces reified attributes, a simple and effective way to model business data.<br/>
            Attributes are also known as fields, properties or columns.<br/>
            In most data models (relational, object, noSql), they have limited scope: table or object definition.<br/>
            Reified attributes are attributes defined <i>globally</i>. Being global, they become shared by all tables and object definitions.<br/>
            Amongst other benefits, reified attributes:
            <ul>
                <li>enable new search capabilities</li>
                <li>enable a single data model across all application tiers</li>
                <li>enable enterprise level controlled vocabularies</li>
                <li>enable semantic types, as opposed to technical types</li>
                <li>eliminate the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance">deadly diamond problem</a></li>
                <li>eliminate the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch">impedance mismatch problem</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Global names</h2>

        <p>Prompto names are global i.e. there is no concept of namespace in Prompto.<br/>
            At Prompto, we believe namespaces make sense for technical components, but not for business domains.<br/>
            If a given name has a different meaning in 2 departments of the same business, then it is likely to create business issues, unrelated to IT.
            That problem should be solved by adopting common terminology across departments, not through IT islands.<br/>
            A side-effect of having global names is that names need to be chosen carefully.<br/>
            At Prompto, we believe this is a feature: it encourages high quality of naming.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Global and dynamic polymorphic methods</h2>

        <p>Prompto methods can either be attached to object definitions or be global, like in Python or JavaScript.<br/>
            Prompto methods are polymorphic i.e. 2 methods with the same name can coexist if they accept a different set of parameters, like in Java or C#.<br/>
            However Prompto goes a step further by selecting the most appropriate method at <i>execution time</i> rather than <i>compile time</i>.<br/>
            This feature greatly simplifies development and data modeling, by eliminating the need for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch">double dispatch</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Prompto dialects: syntax is a detail</h2>

        <p>To facilitate the conversation between all breeds of developers, Prompto comes with not one "language" but three.<br/>
            Prompto calls these <i>dialects</i>, as they are not independant languages, but rather 3 syntactic variations of the same language concepts.<br/>
            They make it very easy for any developer to adopt the Prompto platform, whatever his/her technical background.<br/>
            Prompto <i>dialects</i> seamlessly translate to one another.<br>
            By doing so, they eliminate the barrier of having to learn a formal grammar only to read code.<br/>
            They are a collaborative tool which helps technologists work together.
