        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Prompto is a platform for building and running information systems.<br/>
        It comprises different components:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>a code store used to store and distribute application code across the infrastructure</li>
            <li>data store adapters, used to store business data in popular distributed data stores</li>
            <li>administration tools, used to manage execution of applications on the infrastructure</li>
            <li>development tools, used to build applications, test them, and validate them</li>
            <li>a programming language, named Prompto</li>
        </ul>
        This reference focuses on the programming language, and may sometimes refer to other components.
        </p>

        <h2>Business applications</h2>

        <p>Business applications are applications which focus on business logic and user interaction,
            as opposed to middleware applications which focus on technical tasks such as data storage,
            message broadcasting, or serving web pages.<br/>
            Business applications typically make heavy use of a database, and span across multiple components: database, back end and front end.<br/>
            Prompto is designed to help organizations be more effective in building business applications.<br/>
            It achieves this by focusing on business logic, integration and presentation, while still relying for technical tasks
            on the exceptional ecosystems available from traditional platforms.
        </p>

        <h2>Run everywhere</h2>

        <p>Business applications are typically built using languages such as Java, C#, Python, JavaScript and Swift.<br/>
            There is a Prompto runtime for each of those host languages, and they are 100% compatible with each other.<br/>
            Prompto runs as part of its host languages and thus fully integrates with them.<br/>
            Prompto comprises data manipulation instructions which remove the need to program in SQL.<br/>
            Prompto runs in Java, C#, Python or JavaScript. It natively integrates with any back end infrastucture.<br/>
            Prompto also runs in browsers, Java RCP, .Net RCP and native iOS applications (Swift runtime not available yet).
        </p>

        <h2>Interpreted <i>and</i> compiled</h2>

        <p>Prompto runs in both interpreted and compiled mode.<br/>
            The Java runtime comes with an interpreter and a compiler which is able to compile Prompto code to JVM byte code.<br/>
            The C# runtime comes with an interpreter and a compiler which is able to compile Prompto code to CLR byte code (compiler not available yet).<br/>
            The Python 2 and Python 3 runtimes come with an interpreter and a transpiler which is able to transpile Prompto code to Python byte code (transpiler not available yet).<br/>
            The JavaScript runtime come withs an interpreter and a transpiler which is able to transpile Prompto code to JavaScript code (transpiler not available yet).<br/>
            The Swift runtime is planned but not available yet.
        </p>

        <h2>Statically inferred types</h2>

        <p>Prompto uses static typing, like Java or C# do. This is required to ensure best performance on these platforms.<br/>
            However, Prompto relies heavily on type inference, thus freeing the developer from having to declare obvious types.<br/>
            When writing <code>a = 123</code> code, it is obvious that <code>a</code> is an integer, so there is no need to declare it.<br/>
            Method parameter types still need to be declared though, because they cannot be inferred.
        </p>

        <h2>Reified attributes</h2>

        <p>Prompto introduces reified attributes, a simple and effective way to model data.<br/>
            Attributes are also known as fields, properties or columns.<br/>
            In most data models (relational, object, noSql), they have limited scope: table or object definition.<br/>
            Reified attributes are attributes defined globally. Being global, they can then be shared by all tables and object definitions.<br/>
            Amongst other benefits, reified attributes:
            <ul>
                <li>enable new search capabilities</li>
                <li>enable a single data model across all application tiers</li>
                <li>enable enterprise level controlled vocabularies</li>
                <li>enable semantic types, as opposed to technical types</li>
                <li>eliminate the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance">deadly diamond problem</a></li>
                <li>eliminate the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch">impedance mismatch problem</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Global names</h2>

        <p>Prompto names are global i.e. there is no concept of namespace in Prompto.<br/>
            At Prompto, we believe namespaces make sense for technical components, but not for business domains.<br/>
            If a given name has a different meaning in 2 departments of the same business, then it is likely to create business issues, unrelated to IT.
            That problem should be solved by adopting common terminology across departments, not through IT islands.<br/>
            A side-effect of having global names is that names need to be chosen carefully.<br/>
            At Prompto, we believe this is a feature: it encourages high quality of naming.<br/>
        </p>

        <h2>Prompto dialects: syntax is a detail</h2>

        <p>To facilitate the conversation between all types of developers, Prompto comes with not one "language" but three.<br/>
            Prompto calls these dialects, as they are not independant languages, but rather 3 syntactic variations of the same language concepts.<br/>
            They make it very easy for any developer to adopt the Prompto platform, whatever his/her coding background.<br/>
            Prompto dialects seamlessly translate to one another.<br>
            By doing so, they eliminate the barrier of having to learn a formal grammar only to read code.<br/>
            They are a collaborative tool which helps technologists work together.
