        <h2>Setters</h2>

        <p>Attribute values are normally set siply by copying the value provided when creating objects or assigning a value to an attribute.</p>

        <p>This covers most use cases, but there are situations where you want to:

        <ul>
                <li>validate the value in a way which is not supported by attribute constraints</li>
                <li>transform the value "on the fly" rather than just store it</li>
                <li>take the opportunity to populate other values</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <p>This is where <i>setters</i> are useful.</p>
    <p><i>Setters</i> are special methods defined as part of a category definition, and attached to a particular attribute name.
        When a setter is defined and a piece of code tries to set the corresponding attribute, including when the object is created,
        Prompto will call the <i>setter</i> to transform the value prior to setting it.<br/>
        Within the setter method body, the name of the attribute being set holds the value received, which can be used for whatever purpose.
        The setter is a function which MUST return the value to be written.</p><p>
        In the below example, we define a <i>setter</i> for a <i>fullName</i> attribute which returns a capitalized value, and sets the <i>initials</i> attribute:
        </p>

        <p/>

            <iframe class="displayer displayer-16-lines" name="c1" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>


        <h4>Cyclical dependencies</h4>
        <p><i>Prompto manages cyclical dependencies between setters. Cyclical dependencies occur when for example setter for 'a' sets 'b' and setter for 'b' sets 'a'.
            During the execution of a setter body, it is guaranteed that the setter being executed will not be called again for the current object
            until the execution of the initial setter is complete.</i></p>
