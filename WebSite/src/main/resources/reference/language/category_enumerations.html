        <h2>Category enumerations</h2>

        <p>An enumeration is a list of names for constant values of a particular type.<br/>
            Enumerations are practical to refer to values using symbols, rather than provide the same value again and again in your code.<br/>
            Prompto supports enumerations of both built-in and category types.<br/>
            This section describes enumerations of category types.<br/>
        </p>

        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c1" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>Enumerated symbols are global definitions. You cannot redefine the above name <code>MOTORBIKE</code> elsewhere.<br/>
            Enumeration symbols must be composed of uppercase letters, digits and '_' only. The first character cannot be a digit.<br/>
            This makes it easy to recognize enumerated symbols at first glance.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>Once an enumerated symbol is defined, it can be used anywhere in place of the value itself.<br/>
        </p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c2" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>
            Enumeration attributes
        </h3>
        <p>On top of their category attributes, category enumeration values have the following attributes:<br/>
        <ul>
             <li><code>name</code>: returns the name of the enumerated symbol as a Text value</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The enumeration itself has the following attributes:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li><code>symbols</code>: returns a List of the symbols in the enumeration</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-12-lines" name="c3" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>
            Enumeration methods
        </h3>
        <p>Category enumerations do not directly support methods. However, they can be derived from existing categories, making it easy to provide custom methods.</p>
        <p>In the below example, we:
        <ul>
            <li>define a 'MobileDevice' category with a 'printSpeed' method</li>
            <li>define a 'Vehicle' enumeration which derives from 'MobileDevice'</li>
            <li>call the 'printSpeed' method on an enumerated instance</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-20-lines" name="c4" class="embed-responsive-item" src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Enumerations of built-in types</h3>
        <p>Prompto supports Enumerations of built-in types. See Enumerations for details.</p>
