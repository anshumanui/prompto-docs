        <h2>Copying objects i.e. creating objects from existing ones</h2>

        <p>In Prompto, attributes are semantic types i.e. they have the same meaning across the entire solution.</p>
        <p>This enables powerful features such as automatically copying attribute values between independent
            objects.</p>
        <p>In the below example, we:
        <ul>
            <li>define a Person category</li>
            <li>define an Employee category</li>
            <li>create a Person: john</li>
            <li>create an Employee: new_joiner, copied from john</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c1" class="embed-responsive-item"
                    src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>

        <h3>Populating additional attribute values when copying objects</h3>
        <p>On top of copying values, you may need to populate additional attribute values:</p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c2" class="embed-responsive-item"
                    src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
        </div>
        <p/>
        <h3>Overwriting attribute values when copying objects</h3>
        <p>Eventually, you might need to overwrite existing values:</p>
        <div>
            <iframe class="displayer displayer-10-lines" name="c3" class="embed-responsive-item"
                    src="../../code/displayer.html" runnable></iframe>
