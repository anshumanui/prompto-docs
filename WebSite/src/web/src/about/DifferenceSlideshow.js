                <h2>Build in the cloud</h2>
                <p>Prompto information systems live entirely in the cloud.<br/>
                    Infrastructure is in the cloud.<br/>
                    Management tools are in the cloud.<br/>
                    Development tools are in the cloud.<br/>
                    Business applications are in the cloud.<br/>
                </p>


                <h2>Prompto components</h2>
                <p>Prompto comprises different components:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>cloud administration tools</li>
                    <li>application administration tools</li>
                    <li>development tools</li>
                    <li>a code store used to store and distribute application code</li>
                    <li>data store adapters, used to store business data in popular cloud based data stores</li>
                    <li>a programming language, called Prompto</li>
                </ul>



                <h2>How is this different from traditional tools?</h2>
                <p>Many of the technologies currently used to build applications were designed long before the cloud was
                    even dreamt of.<br/>
                    As a consequence, organizations have a hard time building applications for the cloud, and deploying them
                    in the cloud.</p>
                <p>Information systems are built from many applications, often dozens, sometimes hundreds of them.<br/>
                    Making applications work together is a task in itself, proven to be complex even when using simple
                    infrastructure.<br/>
                    While the cloud may simplify some aspects such as hardware provisioning, it can increase the inherent
                    complexity of running an information system.
                </p>
                <p>Prompto introduces a radically different approach, where the information system itself is in the cloud.<br/>
                    This includes all core components of the information system: deployment, load balancing, replication,
                    backup,
                    monitoring, OS upgrades, DNS, authentication, entitlement and so forth.<br/>
                    It also includes the IDE for creating web pages and writing application code.
                </p>
                <p>Prompto is designed from the ground up to run in the cloud, whether public or private.</p>
                <p>While the Prompto technology takes care of infrastructure, security and scalability, the applications
                    running within this
                    information system can focus on business value.
                </p>
            </div>
